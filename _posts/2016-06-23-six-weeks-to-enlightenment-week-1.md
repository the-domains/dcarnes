Assume your posture ­ not too tight, not too loose. Spine and head straight.

**Opening** ­**The 4 Instructions of Gampopa   
(say this out loud to yourself)**  
Let my heart turn to practice.  
Let practice become a path.  
Let this path dissolve confusion.  
Let confusion become wisdom.

**Attitude ­ **  
Invoke the 3 Companions ­ 

Gentleness, Patience, Playful Curiosity 

-then-

Body like mountain   
Breath like wind
  
Mind like sky

Sit as if your head and spine are pulled up by a string. Neutral gaze - not up or down. Relax
your jaw, place your tongue on the roof of your mouth. Relax your hands on your knees, thumb
and forefinger touching. Breathe naturally through your nose.

Follow your breath, in and out. When you get distracted, go back to your breath. Repeat
10,000,000 times.

You are exercising the ability to return to your anchoring object, your breathing in this case. You
aren't trying to be peaceful or calm or feel any particular way. You can't control how you feel ­so don't even try. Just notice when you get distracted and go back to the breath.

You will eventually settle.

**Closing (say this out loud to yourself)**Goodness comes from this practice now done  
Let me not hold it just in me  
Let it spread to all that is known  
And awaken good throughout the world

**Journaling**

At the end of your session write down how you felt as you began and how you felt at the end.
Write down any thoughts, feelings or sensations that seem to recur or stand out.

Post questions or comment of anything that you notice and are willing to share. Your questions or comments may help your fellow Enlighteners. If you want to keep it
private, you can ask me directly and it will stay between us.

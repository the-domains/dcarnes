How Airbnb met their audience's needs

At the [99U conference][0] in NYC, Joe Gebbia, founder of Airbnb, spoke about how his success with the startup came to be. Read more on the story [here][1].

So how did they do it? How did this startup succeed above most others?

**First, they fulfilled a need. **People needed places to stay where "the hospitality was genuine and the M&Ms didn't cost $6." However, it didn't just happen for them. They got rather lucky when during the 2008 Democratic National Convention, most hotel rooms were booked and people needed a place to stay.

After this initial success, they still had work to do. These users visited the site, which created nice spikes in web traffic, but it wouldn't last. 

**So then, they reviewed and improved their business model and create a digital marketing strategy. **Joe did what we all should do. He actually went to his users and he spoke with them. He asked what they wanted, what they disliked about Airbnb and what type of content they would come to the site for. He even asked how they would like to be contacted if Airbnb reached out with content. 

So there you have it. Joe and team figured out how to meet their audiences' needs. 

Ask yourself, who is your audience? What are their challenges? What problem is your business going to solve? And how will you reach them online in the way that they want to be reached? 

These questions are the first to ask in creating audience personas. These personas, or set of personas depending on how widespread your audience is, is what allows your organization to see through your client's eyes. You can better determine what they would do and then form your strategy around this.

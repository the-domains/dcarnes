<p>What made Maya Angelou the creative force she was? </p><p>If you haven't read it yet, consider adding <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/daily-rituals-mason-currey/1112313657?ean=9780307273604"><i>Daily Rituals: How Artists Work </i>by Mason Currey</a> to your summer reading list. The book compiles the daily regimes of visual artists, composers, musicians and writers and gives the reader a glimpse of how that person approached their work. We got an answer to our question above as Maya Angelou was featured in the book. </p><p>For starters, the "where" is important in her work: even though she was a writer without an office space, she didn't do work at home. Rather, she would go to a hotel or motel room to create a new work space. Perhaps this augmented her anonymity. She wanted to keep her space at home "pretty" and separate. </p><p>As for the "when," she’d start her day early, having coffee with her husband and then would leave to work. If she wasn't feeling productive, or in her writing "groove," by midday, she would leave. When done for the day, she'd go home, shower and make dinner. When Angelou’s husband came home, they often had a drink after dinner, perhaps reading what she had written earlier aloud to her husband. This wasn't so he would critique her work. She just used it as a way to hear what she'd written.</p><p>Her daily rituals are admirable. She dove right in, early in the morning, but also recognized when she needed to change her perspective. Despite her busy life, she made it a priority to eat with her family. She also wasn't afraid to share her work even if it wasn't yet done. </p><p>Other artists covered in the book provide us with more ideas for daily rituals. They took long walks, spent time in nature. Many of them got up early in the day and most all of them worked every day, even if they weren't feeling particularly inspired. </p><p>For my wife Lisa, her summer daily rituals include more time outside, more walking and being more deliberate in her working patterns. </p><p>As the seasons change, think about your daily ritual. What makes you effective? Where are you most creative? What makes you happy?</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="14"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="15"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="16"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="17"><span data-reactid="18"><!-- react-empty: 19 --><h2 data-reactid="20"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="21">A day in the life of Maya Angelou</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="24"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
